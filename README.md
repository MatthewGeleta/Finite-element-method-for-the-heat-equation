# Finite-element-method-for-the-heat-equation
This repository contains MATLAB code for a finite element solution to the stochastic heat equation with non-zero
Dirichlet boundary conditions and forcing function on a non-simple domain.

The code is based on the paper "Semigroups and Finite Elements for the Stochastic Heat Equation", by Matthew Geleta,
submitted as a special topic for an MSc degree in Mathematics at The University of Oxford.

Details:
Galerkin approximation using triangular cells and Lagrange basis elements.
Time-stepping is implemented using a backward-Euler scheme.
Stochastic integrals are computed using the Euler-Maruyama method.
